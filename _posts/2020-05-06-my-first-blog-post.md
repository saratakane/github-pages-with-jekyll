This is my first blog post. This is a brand new skill I am trying to learn in my free time. I am not the best writer, but thank you for being here anyway. :) I spent a lot of hours and time in the past five years broken and lost. I had beautiful moments. Beautiful memories were made in the name of love. But I did abandon myself and I have spent a lot of time asking myself why. Hopefully someone out there can relate to these "othering" feelings that white supremacy will have us feeling and hopefully we can combat them together. My gratitude is one of only several things I can control in this life. Thank you for being here.
