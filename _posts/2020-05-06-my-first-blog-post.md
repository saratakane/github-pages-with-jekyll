This is my first blog post. This is a brand new skill I am trying to learn in my free time. I am not the best writer, but thank you for being here anyway. :) Although I had beautiful moments and beautiful memories made in the name of love, I spent a lot of hours and time these past five years feeling broken and lost. I did abandon myself and I have spent a lot of time since then asking myself why. Hopefully someone out there can relate to these "othering" feelings that white supremacy will have us feeling and hopefully we can combat them together. My gratitude is one of only several things I can control in this life. どうもありがとうございます_cảm ơn
P.S. saratakane.github.io coming soon LOL
